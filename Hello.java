//if we run javac Hello.java we get Hello.class file that
// gets automatically created that contains the compiled code (byte code) so now we can run the code using 
//java Hello((JVM+libararies) = inside JRE  will runned and JVM is actually responsible to run it) then the code in Hello.java will be executed


//now javac is only for devlopment purpose if we want t o run the same code on frnd machine he nneeds to have jRE and JVM not JDK
